You will be provided with a temporary workshop license that will give you access to all products used in the workshop, as well as the workshop exercise files. 

## Step I. Set Up Your MathWorks Account  

If you don’t have a MathWorks account, you need to create one to get access to MATLAB Online and the material for this event. You will need access to your email on the machine you are using to create the account.  

## Step II. Activate the Workshop License  

The workshop uses MATLAB Online. You must activate the workshop license to participate. You can activate this license starting from the day of the workshop up to a week after the workshop date.
